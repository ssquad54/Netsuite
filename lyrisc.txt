Verse 1:
I'm ten years older, you're ten years younger
Our love is strong, despite our age difference
We may have different beliefs, from different religions
But our love is pure, with no conditions

Chorus:
We're conquering the miles, despite the distance
Our love is strong throughout the night's romance
With love in our hearts and trust in our souls
We're making it work, and reaching our goals

Verse 2:
It's not always easy, with the miles between us
But we find a way, to make this love keep growing
We cherish the moments we have together
And hold on to hope for the day we'll meet each other

Chorus:
We're conquering the miles, despite the distance
Our love is strong throughout the night's romance
With love in our hearts and trust in our souls
We're making it work, and reaching our goals

Bridge:
We may not be able to hold each other tight
But our love will guide us through the night
We'll keep on fighting, we'll never give up
We'll make it through, and rise above.
